# Transformer-Projects
# Summary of the Code
This Python program uses the Hugging Face transformers library to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a sample text using a pre-trained BERT model (dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english). The NER task identifies and classifies entities (such as names, organizations, and locations) within the input text.

# Key Steps:
# Model Loading: The program loads a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for the NER task using the pipeline function from the transformers library.
# Input Text: A sample text, "Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla.", is provided for entity extraction.
# NER Processing: The NER model processes the input text and identifies potential entities, returning their respective words, labels (entity types), and confidence scores.
# Output: The program prints out the entities identified in the text along with their labels and confidence scores.

Entity: Elon, Label: B-PER, Confidence: 0.998
Entity: Musk, Label: I-PER, Confidence: 0.999
Entity: SpaceX, Label: B-ORG, Confidence: 0.998
Entity: Tesla, Label: B-ORG, Confidence: 0.998

# Inference from the Output:
# Entities Identified:
Elon Musk is recognized as a Person (denoted by B-PER for the beginning of a person entity and I-PER for the continuation of the same entity).
SpaceX and Tesla are recognized as Organizations (denoted by B-ORG).
Confidence Scores: Each entity has an associated confidence score between 0 and 1, which indicates how likely the model believes the word or token is part of the identified entity. In this case, all entities have high confidence (close to 1), indicating accurate predictions.
# Inferences:
# Accuracy: The model effectively identifies key entities such as names (e.g., "Elon Musk") and organizations (e.g., "SpaceX", "Tesla").
# Entity Labels: The model uses the standard BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) format for entities in NER.
B-PER and I-PER represent the beginning and continuation of a person's name, respectively.
B-ORG represents the beginning of an organization's name.
This demonstrates the ability of transformer-based models like BERT to perform complex NER tasks with high accuracy and confidence.
